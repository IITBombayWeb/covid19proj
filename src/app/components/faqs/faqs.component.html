			  are continuously improving the predictions as we get
			  fresh data. Our model correctly captures
			  the generic behaviour seen across the world for
			  COVID-19. We have also provided two scenarios
			  “Moderate and Worst case”.  It is better to
			  be well stocked beforehand than to be without any
			  clue of the future requirements. </p></li>
