                      <li><p> As with any statistical model, here too
			  we cannot assure exactness of the
			  prediction. The model is more accurate in
			  places having more than 10 deceased, and
			  that have followed similar interventions
			  used in most countries.  The projections for
			  the following week is more accurate than
			  further in the future. The model
			  continuously revises the predictions as
			  fresh data becomes available.  The
			  historical performance of the model will
			  soon be available for viewing here.  Please
